This is a 3x3 TicTacToe game. The modes include the following player combinations: (1) human-player against human
-player, (2) machine and human-player, with options for whether the machine goes first.
When the machine plays, the user will be prompted for whether the alpha-beta game tree
pruning algorithm should be used. If not, the Minimax algorithm (without pruning)
will be used.
